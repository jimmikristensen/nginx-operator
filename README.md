# nginx-operator
// TODO(user): Add simple overview of use/purpose

## Scaffolding
```
# Init operator project
operator-sdk init --plugins go/v4-alpha --domain nginx.example.com --repo github.com/jimmikristensen/nginx-operator --skip-go-version-check -- project-name nginx-operator

# scaffold API and controller
operator-sdk create api --group webserver --version v1alpha1 --kind Nginx --plugins="deploy-image/v1-alpha" --image=nginx:alpine

# update Makefile to name the operator docker image by name and version
-IMG ?= controller:latest
+IMG ?= $(IMAGE_TAG_BASE):$(VERSION)

# build the operator image
make docker-build

# load the operator docker image onto kind
kind load docker-image nginx.example.com/nginx-operator:0.0.1

# to list images available in rge kind cluster
docker exec -it $(kind get clusters | head -1)-control-plane crictl images

# deploy the operator
make deploy

# after deployment you should see the controller and the crd in the cluster
# look for pod(s) running the controller and CRDs in the cluster

# Deploy the CR
kubectl apply -f config/samples/webserver_v1alpha1_nginx.yaml
```

## Description
// TODO(user): An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/nginx-operator:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/nginx-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
